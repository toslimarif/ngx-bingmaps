# Bing Maps - Angular

A simple and modular library for displaying Bing Maps inside an angular application.

The library is designed to be lightweight, relying on the official [Bing Maps V8 Web Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/v8-web-control/?redirectedfrom=MSDN) SDK as a dependency. Its purpose is to alleviate the challenges of integrating Bing Maps into your Angular Projects.
